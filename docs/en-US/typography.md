## Paragraph

[Mi](#)ALWAYS BELIEVE
THAT SOMETHING WONDERFUL
IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN

> The "MI" in our logo stands for “Mobile Internet”. It also has other meanings, including "Mission Impossible", because Xiaomi faced many challenges that

   "Just for fans" – that's our belief. Our hardcore Mi fans lead every step of the way. In fact, many
Xiaomi employees were first Mi fans before joining the team. As a team, we share the same relentless 
pursuit of perfection, constantly refining and enhancing our products to create the best user experience 
possible. We are also fearless in testing new ideas and pushing our own boundaries. Our dedication 
and belief in innovation, together with the support of Mi fans, are the driving forces behind our 
unique Mi products.
